Personal Portfolio
 I’ve just created my first-ever personal portfolio webpage! I’m so glad I gave it a try. This page brings together everything I’ve learned so far: from interactive games and web designs to Java-based applications. It showcases the projects I’ve worked on, the skills I’m currently learning, and my journey as a web developer.

It may not be perfect, but as a beginner, I’m genuinely proud of what I’ve built using just HTML and CSS. This process has helped me understand front-end development more deeply — and it’s only the beginning.
